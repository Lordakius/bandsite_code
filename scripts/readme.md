some scripts that I use(d) to make maintenance and addition of new content easier 

## lyricify

first, create a new file and paste the songtext into it. Running the tool, it will add 2 whitespaces at the end of each line, so that the markdown will read it as a line break, automating the addition of new lyrics
Afterwards, insert a breakline at every paragraph.

todo: add header automatically afterwards
